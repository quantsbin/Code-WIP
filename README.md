Financial Crisis –
Characteristics and Cause



 



Financial Crisis could be loosely defined as a scenario under which
liquidity evaporates from market because of large gap between demand and supply
of money. Such scenario often starts with sudden deterioration in perception of
large group of investors about particular asset class. This leads to investor
rushing to sell underlying without many takers in market causing huge decline
in financial instruments value. In short duration the financial asset loses
large part of its nominal value, causing large losses for institutions holding
these assets. When banks have large exposures to such assets this situation
propagates to general public. As a result, retail investors and bank depositors
worried about losing money by continuing to be a part of these financial institutions,
go for mass withdrawals of deposits, causing bank-run. Bank run acts as vicious
cycle, further impacting financial institutions’ health and eventually dragging
them to a state of insolvency. 



 



Relaxation of financial regulations generally precedes a financial
crisis. Institutions incentivized to book short term gains start circulating
such assets and work on self-fulfilling prophecies. Driven by the sentiments of
the institutions, investors rush to the market without analyzing and understanding
the uncertainties attached with their investment. They increase their exposure
by taking leverage, assuming the up run to continue forever. The situation is
extravagated to dangerous levels when reliable information is not available
because of opaque or lack of disclosure and absence of restriction on
institutions to maintain right asset-liability match.



 



Common characteristics that could define any financial crisis could be
broadly given as:



1.            Liquidity Crunch



2.            Fragile state of
financial system



3.            Loss of trust of
investor in the financial system as a whole



4.            Asset boom and burst



5.            Regulatory Failure



 



 



The Global Financial Crisis of
2007-08 — A Case Study of Financial Crisis



 



The Global Financial Crisis is considered by many as the worst
financial crisis that hit the global market after the Great Depression of 1929.
It first surfaced in September 2008 and was marked with the collapse of US
investment bank, Lehman Brothers, after which several banks followed suit. The
crisis originated primarily from the US housing market and later engulfed
complete financial sector across the world. 
Economist around the world attribute financial market liberalization and
deregulation as the two prime factors responsible for the crisis.



 



House prices in the US started to increase at a much faster pace from
the year 2000 than it had in the previous decade. The US government’s keenness
to encourage home ownership resulted in the interest rates being dropped very
low during the period between 2002 and 2005. Additionally, financial
institutions in their greed to pocket more commissions on mortgage loans
started sanctioning subprime loans under the assumption that house prices will continue
to increase forever and with the houses kept as collateral poses virtually no
risk. The passing of the “anti-deficiency” law, which protected the public from
taking any personal liability, coupled with the low interest rate encouraged
people to increase mortgage borrowing as a means to make easy money. Consequentially,
the period from 2000 to 2006 saw a huge increase in subprime mortgage lending. 



 



Meanwhile, in order to make easy profit, investment banks created
collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) from the mortgages purchased on the
secondary market. The CDOs were perceived to be a promising investment
instrument capable of giving high returns in short terms, while the underlying
risks associated with it were not properly disclosed. Rating agencies moved
from their traditional business of rating bonds, where they had a great deal of
experience, to rating CDOs, which were relatively new and for which there were
relatively little historical data. In additional to this there was always
conflict of interest, with financial institutions incentivizing the rating of
their CDOs for the rating agencies.



 



In an attempt to keep making profits by increasing mortgage lending
amid rising real estate prices, mortgage lenders and brokers developed
Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs) wherein there was a low “teaser” rate of interest
that would last for two or three years and be followed by a rate that was much
higher. Further, the applicant’s income and other information reported on the
application form were frequently not checked.



 



The bubble burst in 2007, when many mortgage holders found that they
could no longer afford their mortgages when the teaser rates ended. This led to
foreclosures and large numbers of houses coming on the market, resulting in a
decline in house prices. As foreclosures increased, the losses on mortgages also
increased. Many financial institutions and investors that had taken big
positions in some of the CDO tranches incurred huge losses and had to be
rescued with government funds. Huge losses were also suffered by insurance
giants that were providing protection on these CDO tranches, many of which had
been originally given AAA rating.
